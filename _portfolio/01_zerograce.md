              <b>Concept:</b> Two astronauts race into space, trying to reach their ship. They use the gas pressure in an extinguisher to move around. This resource is limited though, so they have to stop at stations to recover some gas. Space isn't empt; the players will have to avoid the many asteroids, explosive barrels and even blackholes, while enemy spaceships shoot at them. At stations, the astronauts can also get some items, either to help them progress through the obstacles, or to slow their opponent.<br>
              <b>Role:</b> Procedural generation of obstacles in infinite map
