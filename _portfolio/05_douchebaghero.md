              <b>Concept:</b> We wanted to make a RTS but with villagers that would be smart enough to be autonomous. We implemented a behaviour tree working with a finite state machine that gives the villagers different priorites according to the context. The player controls a hero that has to defend the villagers while they build the village.<br>
              <b>Role:</b> Villagers and enemies AI, resources random generation, UI, hero controls, animations, audio and visual feedbacks<br>
