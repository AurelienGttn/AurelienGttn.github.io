              <b>Context:</b> This is the first game I did all by myself. I had been learning about video games and Unity for three months but I had only produced games within a small group. I challenged myself to see what I could produce alone and in a short amount of time. That's how I decided to make a 2D arcade mobile game at Montreal airport during the 4 hours I had to wait for my plane. I was really proud to deliver a working project in the end, even though it was only playable on computer at that point. I kept working on it during Christmas break and published it on the Play Store.
