             <b>Concept:</b> The game takes place in a kid's room, where a little town is in danger. The player has to save it from scary zombie bunnies by controlling several toys. At first he only plays as a simple soldier, but then he gets to drive a tank, an airplane and even a firetruck! Within the time we were given, we only developed one story, but the game can easily be extended to have several little stories in different rooms of the house.<br>
             <b>Role:</b> Airplane controls and levels, room global design, help with firetruck water hose and AI field of view.<br>
